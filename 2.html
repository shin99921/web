    <p>
      A quadcopter, also called a quadrotor helicopter or quadrotor,
      is a multirotor helicopter that is lifted and propelled by four rotors.
      Quadcopters are classified as rotorcraft, as opposed to fixed-wing aircraft,
      because their lift is generated by a set of rotors
      (vertically oriented propellers).
