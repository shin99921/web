  <h1>MONERO (cryptocurrency)</h1>
  <p><font size="5">Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency created in
    April 2014 that focuses on fungibility and decentralization.
    Monero uses an obfuscated public ledger, meaning anybody can
    broadcast or send transactions, but no outside observer can tell the source,
    amount or destination. Monero uses a Proof of Work mechanism to issue new
    coins and incentivize miners to secure the network and validate
    transaction.</font></p>
  <p><font size="5">The privacy afforded by Monero has attracted
    illicit use by people interested in ecading law enforcement
    during events such as the WannaCry Ransomware Attack, or the dark web buying
    illegal substances. Despite this, Monero is actively encouraged
    to those seeking financial privacy, since payments and account balances
    remain entire hidden, which is not the standard for
    most cryptocurrencies.</font></p>

  <h1>Architectuer</h1>
  <p><font size="5">Unlike many cryptocurrencies that are derivatives of Bitcoin, Monero is
     based on the CryptoNight proof-of-work hash algorithm, which comes from the
     CryptoNote protocol. It possesses significant algorithmic
     differences relating to blockchain obfuscation. In particular, the ring
     signatures mix the spender's input with a group of others, making
     it exponentially more difficult to establish a link between each
     subsequent transaction. Also, the "stealth addresses" generated for
     each transaction make it impossible to discover the actual destination
     address of a transaction by anyone else other than the sender and the
     receiver. Finally, the "ring confidential transactions" mechanism hides
     the transferred amount. Monero is designed to be resistant to
     application-specific integrated circuit mining, which is commonly used
     to mine other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. It can be mined somewhat
     efficiently on consumer grade hardware such as x86, x86-64, ARM and GPUs</p>
