  <h1>MONERO (cryptocurrency)</h1>
  <p><font size="5">Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency created in
    April 2014 that focuses on fungibility(대체가능성) and decentralization(분산).
    Monero uses an obfuscated(난독화) public ledger(원장), meaning anybody can
    broadcast or send transactions(업무), but no outside observer can tell the source,
    amount or destination. Monero uses a Proof of Work mechanism to issue new
    coins and incentivize miners to secure the network and validate(유효성검사)
    transaction.</font></p>
  <p><font size="5">The privacy(사적인) afforded(~할 힘이있다) by Monero has attracted
    illicit(불법의) use by people interested in ecading(지키는) law enforcement(시행)
    during events such as the WannaCry Ransomware Attack, or the dark web buying
    illegal substances(물질). Despite this, Monero is actively encouraged(격려의)
    to those seeking(찾는) financial privacy, since payments and account balances
    remain entire hidden, which is not the standard for
    most cryptocurrencies.</font></p>

  <h1>Architectuer</h1>
  <p><font size="5">Unlike many cryptocurrencies that are derivatives(파생상품) of Bitcoin, Monero is
     based on the CryptoNight proof-of-work hash algorithm, which comes from the
     CryptoNote protocol. It possesses(소유하다) significant(중요한) algorithmic
     differences relating(관련) to blockchain obfuscation(난처). In particular(특별한), the ring
     signatures(서명) mix the spender's(지출자) input with a group of others, making
     it exponentially(기하급수적으로) more difficult to establish a link between each
     subsequent(후속의) transaction. Also, the "stealth addresses" generated for
     each transaction make it impossible to discover the actual destination
     address of a transaction by anyone else other than the sender and the
     receiver. Finally, the "ring confidential(기밀) transactions" mechanism hides
     the transferred(양도된) amount. Monero is designed to be resistant(저항하는) to
     application-specific integrated(통합된) circuit(회로) mining, which is commonly used
     to mine other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. It can be mined somewhat(약간)
     efficiently(효율적으로) on consumer grade hardware such as x86, x86-64, ARM and GPUs</p>
