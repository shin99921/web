<p>Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency created in April 2014
  that focuses on fungibility and decentralization. Monero uses an
  abfuscated public ledger, meaning antbody can broadcast or send
  teansactions, but no outside observer can tell the source, amount
  or destination. Monero uses a Proof of Work mechanism to issue new
  coins and incentivize miners to secure the network and validate
  transaction.</p>
