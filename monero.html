<p><font size="5">Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency created in April 2014
  that focuses on fungibility and decentralization. Monero uses an
  abfuscated public ledger, meaning antbody can broadcast or send
  teansactions, but no outside observer can tell the source, amount
  or destination. Monero uses a Proof of Work mechanism to issue new
  coins and incentivize miners to secure the network and validate
  transaction.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The privacy afforded by Monero has attracted
illicit use by people interested in ecading law enforcement during
events such as the WannaCry Ransomware Attack, or the dark web buying
illegal substances. Despite this, Monero is avtively encouraged to those
seeking financial privacy, since payments and account balances remain
entire hidden, which is not the standard for most cryptocurrencies.</font></p>
