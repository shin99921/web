      Service: USAF, CIA  Armament: 2x laser-guided AGM-114 Hellfire missiles
      Propulsion: Rotax 914F four-cylinder engine
      Speed: 84 mph Range: 770 miles Crew: Two (pilot and sensor operator)
      The MQ-1B Predator is an armed, multi-mission, medium-altitude,
      long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft that is
      employed primarily as an intelligence-collection asset and secondarily
      against dynamic execution targets. Given its significant
      loiter time, wide-range sensors, multi-mode communications suite,
      and precision weapons, it provides a unique capability to
      perform strike, coordination and reconnaissance (SCAR) against high-value,
      fleeting, and time-sensitive targets.
      Predators can also perform the following missions and tasks: intelligence,
      surveillance, reconnaissance, close air support, combat search and rescue,
      precision strike, buddy-lase, convoy/raid overwatch, route clearance,
      target development, and terminal air guidance.
      The MQ-1's capabilities make it uniquely qualified to conduct irregular
      warfare operations in support of combatant commander objectives.
